    <h2>Playfulness</h2>
    <p>Most dogs like to have fun. Of course, this largely depends on the breed, but generally, dogs are playful! And smart. If you are looking for a pet you can train, or even talk to, try a dog. Not to mention, some breeds are inately protective. No need to worry about leaving your family home alone if you have the right dog there with them.</p>

    <h2>Their Loyalty</h2>
    <p>A dog will love you through thick and thin. They are the most loyal pet you can buy! Dogs will celebrate with you on your good days, and be there for you on your worst days. You can mistakenly repremand them, or let your emotions get the best of you, but a dog will never leave your side.</p>

    <h2>Diversity</h2>
    <p>Are you a couch potato who likes Netflixing all day? Maybe you are a hunter who gets after waterfowl! Or maybe, you are a high class, sophistocated businessman living in the high rises of New York. No matter your lifestyle, there is a dog breed seemingly put here just for you!</p>
